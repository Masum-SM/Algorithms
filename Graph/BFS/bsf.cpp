/* 
WHY BFS IS USED?
1. For normal level order traversing.
2. Finding shortest path for unweighted graph.

we use Bfs when there are high probability to find ans by visiting shortest path.
for example, 
we need a bike and we know that the batter place for buying bike is sylhet border and comilla border. Our location is dhaka, in such a case, we know that comilla is nearest place to achive bike, and the cost will be less. so we go to comilla. In such type of situation we use BFS.
